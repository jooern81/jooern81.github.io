GIT BRANCHING - develop things separately, eventually merge branches again

git branch #lists all branches available
git branch xxxx #creates a new branch xxxx, xxxx is like a new repository that is somehow related to the master branch
git merge xxxx # merge branch xxxx with the master branch
Remote #a version of the repository that exists externally
git check out xxxx # switch into a specific branch
Fork #create identical repository, eventually merges back with the real repository through a pull request

CONNECTING WEBSITES - webpage linking
<a href="xxxx.html"> CLICK HERE </a> #this tag is inserted in the body can link to 1) a file 2) a website 3) a location within the same webpage
<a href="https://google.com">
<a href="#section1"> #the '#' sign lets the code know that the characters following it is an ID within the code 

<datalist> #in a user input, refer to a list and recommend what the input is filled with

CSS

DESCENDANTS
ol li { color:red #ORDERED LIST -> LIST ITEMS = COLOR ALL LIST ITEMS  UNDER ORDERED LISTS RED
ol > li { color:red #ORDERED LIST -IMMEDIATE DESCENDANTS-> LIST ITEMS = COLOR ALL LIST ITEMS THAT ARE IMMEDIATE UNDER A OL RED

button:hover # hover makes something happen when your mouse hovers over it

a:: before #do something before all 'a' tags
a:: after #do something after all 'a' tags 

MOBILE RESPONSIVITTY
Viewport = Area of the screen you are viewing a website from

MEDIA QUERIES = Assign CSS elements based on the medium it is being viewed on
@media print #only applies the CSS elements when the medium is print

@media (min-width: 500px) - Assign CSS elements based on how wide or narrow a medium is

flexbox = a matrix of boxes that are arranged according to how wide the screen is
grid = fixed columns and rows that scale to fix in the screen
bootstrap = base CSS code that helps you to design your site according to a 'modern' and 12-column style, it has its own classes that can be referred to
check bookstrat documentation if interested. you can manipulate bootstrap classes by referring to them in your CSS code

Sass #an extension to css, filetype is scss.
variables in Sass start with a '$'
you will need to compile the scss file into a css file
you can make Sass watch a specific scss file and compile it as a css file

FLASK - Python' Web Developer

if running for the first time, tell Flask where to look with: export FLASK_APP = application.py
first: from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__) #define the web application name, a Flask Variable called app 
@app.route("/") #the default route of a site
def index():
	return "Hello World!"

@app.route("/<string:name>") #the /name becomes an input for the app

HTML files can be tied into Flask:

from flask import Flask, render_template # FLASK ONLY LOOKS INTO A FOLDER IMMEDIATELY IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE .PY FILE, THE FOLDER MUST BE CALLED templates

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
	return render_template("index.html")

in html files you can use {{variable}} so that the python file can be used to define the variable within the html file
jinja is used to process the template (html) that contains special python-variable, python-loops and python-condition related to the python file containing the template

{% xxx %} does loops and conditions, needs to be phrased in a very specific way

template inheritance - clone template from a template and insert content based on pre-defined blocks, lets you change all the templates that inherited from the parent at the same time

flask can auto-reload in debug mode 
jinja comes together with flask

from flask import Flask, render_template, request # request is used to deal with collecting data from forms

sessions - a user logs into a session and data is shown or recorded based on the session, it is how data is stored from online forms, DATA IS STORED PER SERVER SESSION, when the server restarts all the data stored is lost
sessions - sessions can be shared or personal

SQL Structured Query Language - For interacting with Databases and Data Storage
Serial Data Type - an integer that keeps count
VarChar - variable length of characters

TABLE CREATION
Create Table, Input Column Name and Data Type in the column, INSERT INTO
! specifying NOT NULL as an extension to the data type forces the entry to be filled before it can be submitted
! other constraints include UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY (the way to reference the data in the table), DEFAULT (insert default values), CHECK (operators to check data)

Inserting Data
(col1, col2, col3) VALUES (1,2,3)

SHOWING DATA
SELECT * FROM table;

SELECTIVE DATA
SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = 3;
SELECT(*) COUNT  FROM table WHERE cheese = 'Yes'
SELECT * FROM table WHERE origin LIKE '%a%'; #select things that contain substring 'a'
SELECT origin, COUNT(*) FROM flights GROUP BY origin HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; #how many flights from each origin are there where flights are >1?

UPDATE DATA
UPDATE data
SET duration = 430 WHERE origin ='New York' AND destination ='London';

DELETE DATA
DELETE FROM flights WHERE destination = 'TOKYO';
! database IDs are unique, even if you delete a row, that id will never be used again

LIMIT QUERY OUTPUTS
Receive a limited amount of data

ORDERING DATA
SELECT * FROM flights ORDER BY duration ASC; #order in ascending by duration

FLASK runs SQL commands as well

PRIMARY KEY - the value used to reference an entry in a table

CREATING FOREIGN KEYS
Referencing data between datas
SELECT origin, destination, name FROM flights JOIN passengers ON passengers.flight_id = flights.id #merge on passnger.flights_id and flights.id
REFERENCE

INNER JOIN - only show matches, LEFT JOIN - keep all left table entries and match, RIGHT JOIN - keep all right values and match 

NESTED QUERIES

SQL TRANSACTIONS (BEGIN AND COMMIT - for race conditions)

SQLAlchemy - linked Python and SQL, run SQL commands in Python
fetchall returns a list 

SQL lets you create tables with db.create_all() from a class

JAVASCRIPT - run scripts on client side (.json)

HTML can run javascipt code when run by using the <script> tag
This can allow the HTML code to change while on the same HTML page

Ways to define js variables: 1) var - can access variables within a function, from outside of the function 2) let - only defines the variable within {} 3) const - a variable that cannnot be modified

Data Attributes: you can assign additional attributes to objects by including data-xxxx=xxxx
DOM = Document Object Model: Treating a webpage as an object and making modifications to the object client-side using querySelector and script

EXAMPLE:
document.querySelector(...).onsubmit - () =>

Ajax:
1) HTML Page for form input
2) Form input is received as a DOM variable in js
3) Upon receiving the input, query a API based on the input
4) Return the relevant data from the API
5) Update the variable in js and send it as an update to the HTML page

Socket.IO - allows client and server side to communicate dynamically in real time
1) Connect to socket through js
2) Web socket can now trigger events
3) You can emit data to other sockets and said sockets can process the data emitted and further emit them to other sockets (no refreshing is required - each input received or output sent results in an update) 
#saving inputs/outputs in your server side operations allows the data to be called upon or referred to when the browser is reopened

Single-Page Apps 
HMTL5 History - Change the URL even though the webpage is actually the same (pushState)
onpopstate = pressing the back button or forward button

Window attributes
in js you can extract the details of the window the user is currently viewing
this allows you to trigger events when the user scrolls to a certain point in the page
hide lets you hide elements 

CSS Animation
animation is basically changing the properties of an element over time
animation-name: insert function with start and end state
animation-duration: how long does the transition take
animation-fill-mode: forward or backward

Play state of the animation can be set to paused or running through js

SCALABLE VECTOR GRAPHICS (svg files)
getting whatever drawings you want onto a page

D3: HTML library for plotting graphical elements

Django - A more powerful Flask which makes it easier to set up a web app
Django creates files for you to serve as the foundation of the web app
Django project contains multiple apps - each serving different functions
Routes are linked to functions through two different files

Migrations
Django auto-generates SQL code to migrate (this could also mean create) databases into a new database (with different columns etc.)
Django uses 'context dictionaries' to pass content from a database to a html page

namespacing - creating directories so that files with the same name can exist 

admin app - lets you change the database through a webpage!! it is customizable, allowing you to put some constraints on the inputs for the database 

logging in - Django has log-in functions straight in the web app that lets admins and users log in

Django allows you to define the relationship between tables and it will proceed to generate SQL tables that allow the relationship to work 

01/08/2020
MORE DJANGO
You can add features to the admin file (StackedInLine, FilterHorizontal etc), lets the admin perform more pages on the Django admin interface

TESTING
1) Write a program that inputs stuff into the function and tests the function accordingly
2) Run a series of lines that test the function and maybe output a notification if an exception occurs
3) assert - an in-built function that when asserting if a function is true - and a false is triggered, throws an exception
4) unittest - a library that lets you set up a series of tests (has stuff like asserttrue and assertfalse) - throws out exceptions for any errors that occur.
5) Django has a test file as well - this is built on unittest, you include tests into the the model, you have the advantage of not modifying the original database when running the tests
	i) you can try to go to different pages and see if you get a successful status code as part of the tests
6) Selenium allows you to test javascript code by using a web driver to open the browser, running the javascript code and accessing elements in the javascript and doing stuff to them 

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery 
Travis - a CI tool which supports by running tests automatically every time code is pushed to github
When you push code to GitHub, Github will notify Travis and Travis will pull code and run tests automatically
Need to set up a configuration file using YAML - based on keys and values

Virtual Machines VS Containers
DOCKERS = CONTAINERS = A WAY TO ENSURE WEB APPS RUN THE SAME ACROSS DIFFERENT PLATFORMS
Containerization ditches the Operating System - it just uses whichever OS the user is using - reduces loading speed and memory requirements while keeping consistency
Docker ensures that the Apps and Bins/Libs can work on all OS
Dockers install libraries through a file that specifies what libraries are required, it also states what programs are required to run the application
docker-compose.yml  - the file which lets the docker know what to use, what to run, what to install, what image to use (postgres - link to database)

Python and Flask
First, make sure you install a copy of Python. For this course, you should be using Python version 3.6 or higher.
You’ll also need to install pip. If you downloaded Python from Python’s website, you likely already have pip installed (you can check by running pip in a terminal window). If you don’t have it installed, be sure to install it before moving on!
To try running your first Flask application:

Download the project1 distribution directory from https://cdn.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/1/project1.zip and unzip it.
In a terminal window, navigate into your project1 directory.
Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt in your terminal window to make sure that all of the necessary Python packages (Flask and SQLAlchemy, for instance) are installed.
Set the environment variable FLASK_APP to be application.py. On a Mac or on Linux, the command to do this is export FLASK_APP=application.py. On Windows, the command is instead set FLASK_APP=application.py. You may optionally want to set the environment variable FLASK_DEBUG to 1, which will activate Flask’s debugger and will automatically reload your web application whenever you save a change to a file.
Set the environment variable DATABASE_URL to be the URI of your database, which you should be able to see from the credentials page on Heroku.
Run flask run to start up your Flask application.

RELEASE PRODUCTION VS CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
Git branching is a form of continuous integration
clone the master repository (fork), create a branch, edit file, add it to staging area, commit it, push it to the forked copy of the repository
TRAVIS is part of the master repository and is now in the clone, it can be run to do the testing on the modified clone

Feature control - adding logic to parts of the code to say: IF the feature is released, then consider a part of the code active
Feature toggle - release a feature for specific groups of people

By using Hubot and a chat tool, you can publish the git commands you are running on the chat tool so other people can see what you are doing through git
Slack can also link to your github and give similar notifications

Travis CI
Automated Tests: ASSERT TRUTHS ON THE SYSTEM AND CHECK IF THE SYSTEM'S OUTPUT MATCHES. EDIT SYSTEM UNTILIT DOES
Function Tests: UNIT TEST, COMPONENT TEST, INTEGRATION TEST, END2END

SCALABILITY
Computation is calculated in Hertz - it is the metric used to quantify a server's capacity
Benchmarking - load test a server
Vertical Scaling - increasing server capacity (memory)
Load balancing - determining how to deploy users to a particular server (but load balancing takes comutational power as well)
-random choice
-round robin
-fewest connections

Session-Aware Load Balance
-stick sessions - keep sessions stored so when people exit and return their data is still present
-sessions in database - storing it in all databases OR storing it in a set of databases and retrieve the info from those databases each time the data is required
-client side sessions - cookies, information is stored on the client side, cookies can be used to determine which server a client goes to

DATABASE (stored data) VS SERVER (live service)

Autoscaling - cloud computing where servers are assigned from the cloud based on need

Servers are linked to databases

Databases can be partitioned - to make things easier to find when databases get too big

Vertical partitioning 
-split the columns (this reduces the number of rows in each database)

Horizontal partitioning
-split the rows (some rows belong to some sub-classification)
-weakness: need to change both all tables each time you make an edit, need to cross check data between tables, if you need to remerge the data or query all the databases its slower

Storing data in two databases allows queries to be run simultaneously 

Database replication is a common solution for querying efficiency but it may be hard to sync all databases

Single-Primary Replication (only good for reading, not so good for writing)

UPDATE------------------>----------------------->
DATABASE1 		DATABASE2 		DATABASE3
WRITE/READ		READ			READ

Multi-Primary Replication (must have rules for updating across multiple databases to deconflict index errors etc. 2 people register at the same time)

<-UPDATE->		<-UPDATE->		<-UPDATE->
DATABASE1 		DATABASE2 		DATABASE3
WRITE/READ		WRITE/READ		WRITE/READ

Client Side Caching
Keeping certain pages in the cache and the client loads the page from his cache
Typically you keep an ETag in the cache and it checks at the server side whether the Etag has changed, then decides whether to load from the server side or the client side

Server Side Caching
Server stores a typically large set of data that is frequently requested in the cache and pulls it out as set from the cache as required (saves query time because the cache is so focussed)
